## SAP Data Hub on Amazon EKS


This Quick Start automatically deploys an SAP Data Hub on Amazon EKS environment on the AWS Cloud.

SAP Data Hub provides a set of technologies for data orchestration, metadata management, data governance and integration of your  SAP data with AWS services (such as Amazon S3). 

SAP products and applications such as SAP Business Suite, S/4HANA, SAP Business Warehouse (SAP BW), and SAP BW/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Cloud Platform can be connected with SAP Data Hub. 


The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying SAP Data Hub into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) that's configured for security, scalability, and high availability 
- Deploying SAP Data Hub into an existing VPC in your AWS account

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
